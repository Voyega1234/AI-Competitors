Made to Stick - Book summary
Based on 10 years of study, the Heath brothers answer the question: Why do some ideas succeed while others die? This book provides a practical and systematic way to create ideas that are understood, remembered, and have a long-term impact. In this free Made to Stick summary, we’ll briefly outline the 6 principles to identify and create sticky ideas, and explain how to put it together to drive successful strategies.

The SUCCESs Principles
A “sticky idea” is one that is understandable, memorable, and actually changes perspectives or behaviours. Not all ideas are “stick-worthy”, though it is possible to systematically create sticky ideas, or to learn to spot ideas with potential.

After studying a wide range of ideas and how they are communicated, the Heath Brothers identified 6 principles (SUCCESs) that can be applied as a template or checklist to shape or test any idea for stickiness.

Made to Stick summary - the 6 SUCCESs principles: simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, stories

Here’s an overview of the SUCCESs principles.

1. Simplicity: Finding The Core
Simplicity is not just about using fewer words, shorter phrases or sound bites. It is about:
• Finding the essential core of our ideas; and
• Sharing it in a form of a compact idea

Simple = Core + Compact

For an idea to be compact, there must be a lot of meaning packed into a succinct message, e.g. the simple but powerful proverb “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” The Heath brothers outline several tools and techniques that you can use to create compact communications (e.g. using flags, high-concept pitch, analogies etc.).

2. Unexpectedness: Getting and Retaining Attention
There are 2 parts to this principle:
• Get Attention through the emotion of Surprise
• Keep Attention through the emotion of Interest

Do check out our full 9-page Made to Stick summary for details on effective techniques for creating surprise and sustaining interest.

3. Concreteness: Making Ideas Clear
Experts tend to get more abstract because they have so much knowledge, they tend to see the patterns and insights between details, rather than the concrete details per se. Abstract ideas are hard to understand and remember, and are open to different interpretation.

To help people understand and remember, we must make our ideas clear and concrete. Give a concrete context, provide memory hooks and create a “universal language” that everyone can speak fluently.

4. Credibility: Making Our Ideas Believable
People generally believe ideas under the influence of family, personal experiences, faith, or authorities. However we can also build credibility into our ideas, using both external and internal sources of credibility.  The Heath Brothers explain this in details, including how to use convincing details, statistics, the human-scale principle, Sinatra Test etc. to make our ideas believable.

5. Emotions: Getting People to Care
For people to take action, they first have to care. The book covers several techniques to make people care, such as focusing on the individual (not masses), using associations, appealing to self-interest, and appealing to identity.

6. Stories: Motivating People to Act
This involves 2 parts:
• Simulation (knowledge on how to act); and
• Inspiration (motivation to take action)

Find out from our complete book summary how you can help your audience to rehearse a scenario mentally in their minds, hence preparing them to take the desired actions.  You can also learn the right stories or plot to use to motivate them to take action.
